# Hangman that you never win
Written in rust for backend and HTML for frontend

play it here: https://deepseapenguin.github.io/rust-wasm-hangman/

The HTML and js code is from https://codepen.io/cathydutton/pen/JjpxMm, I mainly focus on coding the wasm part.

Might write an article to describe how I get the words, verify the words, and how player will never win.
